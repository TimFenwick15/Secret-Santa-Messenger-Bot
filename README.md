A Secret Santa Messenger bot.

Currently has code to make Secret Santa pairings from the data provided and send messages to users in a group, but not implemented end to end.

To run, needs the following environment variables settings:
- PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN - a token provided by Facebook
- MY_TOKEN - a token you create for authenticating /webhook requests
